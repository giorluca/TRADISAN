# TRADISAN
This repo contains the first version of TRADISAN, a dataset developed for the Italian language to assess health-related news reliability.

The current dataset consists in 32.100 headlines, each provided with automatic annotations of 31 news reliability features, including stylometric, lexical and sentiment features.
We provide two files: one is the whole dataset, including text and images of the news, but not (yet) annotated; the second file contains the news headlines with their automatic annotations.
